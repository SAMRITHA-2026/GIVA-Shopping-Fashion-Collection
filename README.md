## **About**

Welcome to our Kids' Shopping Website! This platform is designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for both users and administrators.

## **User Experience**

Registration & Login: Users can easily create an account or log in to access personalized features and manage their shopping experience.


Product Browsing: Explore a wide range of products available for kids. Users can filter and search items based on various categories to find exactly what they're looking for.


Cart Management: Add multiple items to the cart with ease. Users can adjust quantities, add or remove items, and view a real-time update of their cart.


Checkout Process: Once the cart is updated, users can proceed to checkout. A demo credit card payment page allows users to enter payment details and place their orders. Please note, this page is for demonstration purposes and is not integrated with a real payment gateway.


Order Confirmation: After successful payment, users can view their order details and track the shipping status in the 'Orders' section.


## **Administrator Functions**

Product Management: Admins have the capability to add new products, update existing items, and remove products from the store. They also manage inventory to ensure accurate stock levels.


Order Management: Admins can view all product orders, update their status, and mark them as shipped or delivered based on current conditions.


## **Email Notifications**

Our website features automated email notifications to enhance user experience:


Registration Confirmation: Users receive a confirmation email upon successful registration.


Order Updates: Users are notified via email when an order is placed and when the product is shipped.


Stock Availability Alerts: If a user tries to purchase an out-of-stock item, they will receive an email when the item becomes available again.
